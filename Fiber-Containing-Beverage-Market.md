Consumer Education and Demand for Transparency</h3><p>As consumers become more informed, their demand for clean-label products will rise. This is particularly relevant in the fiber beverage market, where customers increasingly expect to know the source of their fiber, the quantity used, and its associated health benefits. Transparency in ingredient sourcing and labeling will be a differentiating factor for brands.</p><h3>5.
